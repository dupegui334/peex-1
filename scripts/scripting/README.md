## 1. Scripting: 

### Improve / Fix script

The following script should be taken as an input: https://github.com/realpython/python-scripts/blob/master/scripts/04_rename_with_slice.py. This script renames all files of a specific type in a given folder by removing the last 6 symbols of the existing filename. In this script, the following steps should be taken to improve/fix it:

* sys.argv should be used to avoid hardcoding of folder path (line 4)
* sys.argv should be used to avoid hardcoding a file type (line 5)
* sys.argv should be used to parametrize the desired slicing (line 8)
* String.format() should be replaced with the Python3 f-String (line 14)

#### Example: Check in ./test-folder and slice 1 character of all .json files located there:
```
‚ùØ python3 04_rename_with_slice.py ./test-folder json 1
Current path ~/peex-1/scripts/test-folder
Renamed file.json to fil.json
Renamed file2.json to file.json
```
